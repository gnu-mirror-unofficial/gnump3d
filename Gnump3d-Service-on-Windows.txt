Section 1: Introduction

	This document is meant to walk you through setting up Gnump3d to run 
as a service on your Windows 2k, XP, or 3k computer.  We will be going over
how to setup Firedaemon to start the gnump3d service at boot, and setting 
the service up to restart if it fails or crashes, which can happen unless 
you have 100% compatible mp3 files. If you download a lot of mp3's rather 
then rip your own their is a good chance that you have some that just won't 
play or might even crash Gnump3d.  Nice to have a way to auto-restart when 
you are miles away trying to use it over the web. :)

	This document assumes that you have Gnump3d installed and tested to 
work with the supplied run.bat script.  If you have not done this yet please 
do so, you can receive help for install questions here: http://gnump3d.
sourceforge.net/install.html#Install

	This document also was wrote using version 1.6 of Firedaemon and 
version 2.4 of gnump3d.  If your versions are different, there may be some 
discrepancies.

=============================================================================

Section 3: Needed Programs

	1. A working installed copy of Gnump3d.
	   Description:  GNUMP3d is a streaming server for MP3's, OGG 
	   Vorbis, and other streamable audio files, it is designed to 
	   be: 
	   Small, stable, portable, self-contained, and secure.
	   Simple to install, configure, and use.
	   Portable across different varieties of Unix.
	   Compatible with Perl install on Windows 2k or newer
	   Get it here: http://gnump3d.sourceforge.net

	2. A copy of Firedaemon Lite  (this was wrote using ver. 1.6)
	   Description:  FireDaemon is a utility that allows you to 
	   install and run virtually any native Win32 application or 
	   script (eg. BAT/CMD, Perl, Java, Python, TCL/TK) as a Windows 
	   NT/2K/XP/2K3 service. FireDaemon features easy configuration 
	   (via GUI or XML), a low memory/CPU overhead, subprocess 
	   prioritisation, custom environments, CPU binding plus 
	   monitoring and logging to the event log and on-disk log files.
	   Get it here: http://www.firedaemon.com/

	You should also pick up a 20oz bottle of your favorite beverage.
This should be a 1 bottle project.  If it takes longer then one bottle your 
drinking too much.  :)

=============================================================================

Section 4: Installing Firedaemon

	1.  Download Firedaemon Lite (http://www.firedaemon.com) to your 
desktop.  (Side note on Firedaemon: In the newer free ie. lite versions you 
can only have 1 service running, which will suffice for this project.  If 
you want to run more then one service with Firedaemon you need the pro 
version $25.00 or version 0.9 or older that did not have the 1 service 
restriction. Also a warning the older Firedaemon programs are completely 
different form the current one, so this how-to might be only minimal help 
for you.)
	
	2.  Double Click on the FireDaemon.exe that you downloaded to start 
the install.  The Typical Install will be fine

=============================================================================

Section 5: Added the Gunmp3d Service

	1.  Start Firedaemon by clicking on start, programs, Firedaemon, 
	    FireDaemon Service Manager.

	2.  Click the Service menu and choose New

	3.  Fill out the Tabs according to below:
	    
	    Program Tab
	    Short Name = Gnump3d
	    Display Name = Gnump3d
	    Check the box by "Custom Prefix String" this way if you see 
	    the service running in the normal services window you will 
	    know that you need to go into FireDaemon to change anything 
	    on it.
	    Description = Gnump3d Streaming Media Server
	    Console Application should be Unchecked
	    Working Directory = c:\gnump3d2
		(That is if you haven't changed it)
	    Executable = c:\Perl\bin\perl.exe
		(If your perl install is somewhere else search your hard 
		drive for perl.exe and put in the path to it here.)
	    Parameters = -Ilib/ bin/gnump3d2 --config etc/gnump3d.conf.win --root c:\mp3
		(Remember that the c:\mp3 needs to be changed to wherever 
		you mp3 root folder is)
	    Start-up Time(msec) = 3000

	    Settings
	    Show Window = Hidden
	    Start-Up Mode = Automatic
	    Upon Program Exit = Restart the Program
		(This is what allows gnump3d to be restarted on a crash)

	4.  Click the "Install" button to install the service.  You should 
	    get a box telling you theat the Gnump3d service was installed 
	    successfully.  You can now close the new service box by clicking 
	    the x if the box is still there.  After you return to the main 
	    window of the FireDaemon Lite Service Manager you should see the 
	    Gnump3d Service listing and its Status.  If it is not running 
	    already you can click the "play" symbol to start it up.

	5.  Thats all there is to it.  You can now close the FireDaemon Lite 
	    Service Manager Window.

=============================================================================

Section 5: Trouble Shooting
	
	Currently this section is small, since it is the first revision, if 
this is ever updated, I'm sure there will be more to add to this section.

	1. No songs are showing up if Firedaemon starts the gnump3d 
	   what's up with that?
		Edit the service and check under the programs tab and
		look at the Parameters line at the end you will likely 
		see "c:\mp3" as the notes stated above you need to change
		this to be the directory that your mp3 files are in on
		YOUR computer.

Section 6: Author and Credits

	First I would like to say a awesome thank you to Steve Kemp for 
making such a great streaming media server.  I've had been looking for 
something along these lines for a long time.

	If you have any problems with this How-To you can try contacting me 
at gonecrazy@gonecrazy.com Personally I have this working on a Windows 2000 
server with service pack 4, with no issues whatsoever.

The most current version of the How-To should be linked on http://gnump3d.
