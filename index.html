<h3>GNUMP3d - GNU MP3 Daemon</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;GNUMP3d is a portable, stable, and simple MP3/OGG Vorbis streaming server, complete with an attractive web-based interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Currently the project is hosted upon <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>, but it has recently been dubbed a GNU Program - and is in the process of migration to this site.</p>
