<h3><a name="TOC109">Past Security Attacks</a></h3>

 <p>&nbsp;In the interests of full disclosure this page will stand as a permanent record of any security vulnerabilities which have been discovered in the server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;To date I'm pleased that there has only been one serious problem.  Granted this is one too many, but it's not a bad record</p>


<h4><a name="TOC110">GNUMP3d v2.0 Password File Weakness</a></h4>
<p>&nbsp;GNUMP3d supports two simple methods of securing access to your music archive, (these are described more fully <a href="securing.html#Securing">here</a>), IP address access control and a password system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The password system relies upon their being a file within the music archive containing a list of usernames and passwords which may be used to access the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;When this system was created I was careful to deny browsers the ability to download this file - as part of the re-write in Perl I missed this important step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This meant that if password protection were in use it would be possible for an <i>authentificed</i> user to download the password file - gaining access to all other account names and passwords.</p>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;This vulnerability was spotted and reported to me by Daniel Lyons &lt;<a href="mailto:fusion@nmt.edu">fusion@nmt.edu</a>&gt; and was fixed the same day - with release 2.2</p>
<p>&nbsp;(Due to the fact the release was only out for one day before it was patched, and the low liklihood of this version of the server being widespread in the wild I've chosen to not notify bugtraq et al).</p>
