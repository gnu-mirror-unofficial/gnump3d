<h3><a name="TOC102">Security .. or why I think its safe</a></h3>

<p>One of the goals of this project was to make sure that
 the server was small, stable, and <i>secure</i>.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC103">What does that mean?</a></h4>

<p>By this I mean that your server should not be compromised,
 in any way simply because it is running this software.</p>
<p>With this in mind there are three important things that the
 server should protect against:</p>

<ol>
<li>Nobody should be able to browse your filesystem, except that specific part which you make your server root</li>
<li>Nobody should be able to crash the server, so that you can't use it. (A denial of service attack).</li>
<li>Nobody should be able to trick the server into running code of their choosing</li>
</ol>

<h4><a name="TOC104">Confidence</a></h4>
<p>I'm confident that these things can't happen, because I had them in mind when I was writing the software, but nobody is perfect and I would not like to suggest this software is perfect.</p>
<p>Most of the common buffer overflows should be impossible due to the implementation language of Perl.  Likewise signal attacks, or format string attacks shouldn't be anything to worry about.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC105">Vulnerabilities</a></h4>
<p>Of all the common attacks I believe the only thing that this server is likely to be vulnerable to are "cross site scripting attacks" - this basically means that it may be possible for people to steal the cookies which you are using.</p>
<p>As no cookies are used for authentification, or anything serious I wouldn't be too worried if this did turn out to be the case.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC106">Testing</a></h4>
<p>I believe that my server (this software), doesn't allow anybody
 to subvert your machine - and I've tested this to the best of my ability.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC107">Security Notifications</a></h4>
<p>After reading <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1" title="View bugtraq">BugTraq</a>, etc, I know that having a good contact address is essential - my email address is listed at the bottom of each page on this website, so you shouldn't have too much difficulty in finding it ;)
</p>
<p>(If you wish you may use my <a href="gnump3d@steve.org.uk.gpg">gpg key</a>).</p>

<h4><a name="TOC108">Recognition</a></h4>
<p>Any researcher who discovers a hole in a current release will receive prominent credit upon the front page for a period of not less than one calender month after notifying me.</p>
<p><b>This only applies if</b> the author is contacted <i>before</i> making a disclosure; as any ethical researcher should.  (If you do this then I'm happy for you to post to bugtraq/cert/wherever - after all it's important to spread the news).</p>


<h4><a name="TOC109">Past Vulnerabilities</a></h4>
<p>To date there have been only one reported verified vulnerability in this server.</p>
